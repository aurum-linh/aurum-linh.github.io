    <h1> about </h1>
    <div> hello. i'm aurum. </div>
    <div> I find joy when I’m deep in the mountains, when I’m swimming in cold and clean water, in shared laughter, in
      cooking food for others, and in conversations that help me look at myself and the world with new eyes. </div>
    <div> My core values are kindness, honesty, courage, presence, learning, gratitude, adventure, and laughter. </div>
    <div>I strive to lead my life with love, not with fear. And I want to live a life that is memorable and that adds to
      the overall good in the world. I want to learn as much as I can, and I want to share love, joy, magic, adventure,
      and inspiration wherever I go. </div>
    <div>I believe that no one knows everything, but everyone knows something. We’re all students and teachers in life.
    </div>
    <div>I feel at home when i look up to the sky and see birds flying above the treetops. </div>
